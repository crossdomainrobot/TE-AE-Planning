The above code is used to generate 100 hybrid TE-AE maps of size 30 × 30, where obstacle grids (denoted as O) occupy 30% of the total map area.
The proportions of obstacle types O1, O2, and O3 are 50%, 25%, and 10%, respectively.
To generate maps with different configurations, the following parameters can be modified directly:

-- num_maps: number of generated maps

-- rows, cols: map height and width

-- obstacles: total number of obstacle grids

-- min1: proportion of O1 obstacles

-- min2: proportion of O2 obstacles

-- min3: proportion of O3 obstacles

These parameters allow flexible control over map scale and obstacle distribution.
